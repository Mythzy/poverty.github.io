			<h2>Child Poverty</h2>
            <h4>Child Poverty is an issue that has been happening for countless years. It is an issue that affects many children in the UK and around the globe. UNICEF Has estimated that 356 Million children live in extrerme poverty and itis estimated that 1 billion children (About 1 in 2 children around the world) Do not have access to at least one essential necessity. This involves food, education, clean water and houses. Children are twice as likely to live in poverty as adults and the poorest children are twice as likely to die before the age of 5. In 2018, The UK was 14th in the proportion of children in poverty. Thats 12.4% Of children. There are many causes for child poverty. The majority of children in poverty are born to poor parents. However, there are other causes such as  disabilities, lack of education, unemployment and discrimination. The increased number of single parents is also a major cause of poverty. It has been proven that children from unintended pregancies are more likely to live in poverty. Covid-19 Did not help the situation either, with even more families going into poverty. UNICEF Reported that 100 Million children fell into poverty due to Covid-19. This caused a 10% Increase in childhood poverty between 2019-2021. And finally, the pandemic meant that children who already struggled in education due to lack of resources or their life at home struggled even more.</h4>
